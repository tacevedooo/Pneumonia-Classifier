# Pneumonia Classifier - X-ray Image Analysis

This project implements a **pneumonia classifier** using **chest X-ray images**. The application allows users to upload an image and predict whether it is **NORMAL** or shows **PNEUMONIA**, in **real-time** through an interactive web interface.

## 🔍 Project Description

The application combines **Machine Learning** with a **web frontend** to provide a simple image prediction experience.

- A **ResNet18 deep learning model** is used, trained on chest X-ray images.
- The model is deployed locally using **Flask**.
- Users can upload their images via the browser and receive predictions instantly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **PyTorch**: for building and running the deep learning model.
- **Torchvision**: for image preprocessing and pre-defined architectures.
- **Flask**: web framework for the user interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: for image handling in Python.
- **HTML5 / CSS3**: for the web interface.
